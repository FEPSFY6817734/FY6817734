    <h3> Abstract </h3>
    <p> This paper aims to investigate the profound impact of fluid viscosity on the flow behaviour of crude oil in pipelines. It will also discuss what viscosity is and how to reduce it in crude oil transportation. Transportation of crude oil through pipes is used often and over a great distance and requires a lot of energy. It will also talk about how temperature and external solvents affect viscosity and how it can be reduced.

    <h3> Introduction </h3>
    <p> Introduction
On average about 4141 metric tons (MT) of crude oil are produced yearly and about 30 % of the world's energy is dependent on crude oil (IEA (2021),) , which reinforces the fact that crude oil is a necessity for our survival as humans on this planet. Different countries around the world import and export oil and gas, and the transportation of such products must be as efficient as possible to ensure seamless movement. With that, I will be looking at the most limiting factor (viscosity) in transporting crude oil.
Viscosity is defined as the resistance of fluids to change in shape or movement of neighbouring portions relative to one another Britannica (2023). In simpler terms, it measures how “thick” or “sticky” a fluid s as it flows from a one container to another. It is a result of the intermolecular forces between particles within the fluid. Which is as a result of internal friction caused molecules of oppose velocity Britannica (2023). Viscosity a major factor when considering the amount of energy needed to pump crude from one point to the other. Viscosity can affect both the air and fluids but for this paper I will only cover its effects on fluids. Fluid can exist in two forms namely Newtonian fluids and non-Newtonian fluids.
